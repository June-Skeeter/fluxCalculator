This is a personal "fork" of [EddypPro&reg;](https://github.com/LI-COR-Environmental/eddypro-engine) source code.  I've detached it from the base repo because I don't think the original is being actively maintained and I want the commit history to show up on my github contributions :)  


Modifications include:

* Correction of path length variables for Gill anemometers
* Improved support for reading high frequency binary files
* Support for IRGASON as a default instrument
